# 👋 Meet Me
## Mouad Bensafir
`Computer Science Student @ UM6P - College of Computing`

I’m a builder at heart. For me, tech is a sandbox, not just a field. In fact, you can find all kinds of projects in this account; programms for general audiences, developpers, and more to come! I'm learning everyday and this is a trace of my own evolution. I believe in **learning by doing**, and every repository here is a step toward mastering AI and Data Science.
