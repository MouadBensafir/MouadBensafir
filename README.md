### ✨ About Me
"I’m a builder at heart. For me, tech is a sandbox, not just a field. In fact, you can find all kinds of projects in this account: programs for general audiences and developers, with more to come! I'm learning every day and this is a trace of my own evolution. I believe in **learning by doing**, and every repository here is a step toward mastering AI and Data Science."
